Annotation of research data with metadata is vital to provide context for analysis and data re-use. The odML[1] format enables collecting metadata from different sources in an organized, flexible, human and machine-readable fashion[2] and is easy to use for the scientist. odML specifies the format, not the content, so any metadata necessary to describe a given dataset can be stored.

Starting from the odML format we present an approach that utilizes Semantic Web technologies to effortlessly make even diverse metadata interoperable, findable and accessible according to the FAIR principles[3]. Introducing a small set of general terms derived from the odML format, we defined a mapping from the odML data model to RDF[4] and created a corresponding conversion tool. Thus, metadata collected via the convenient odML format can be fed to a single, searchable local or distributed RDF graph. Taking advantage of the powerful OWL language, each distinct set of metadata can be subclassed to the benefit of maintaining the original relations without losing the common structure, thus achieving interoperability without sacrificing findability.

To provide easy access to large collections of metadata, we introduce an augmented SPARQL server that offers a convenient search interface for the scientist, including a "fuzzy search" feature, and thus provides access to the metadata both by easy to use search terms as well as by using the powerful SPARQL query language.

Maintaining reproducible data workflows while keeping data in sync, backed up, 
and easily accessible from within and outside the lab is a key challenge in 
research. To minimize the time and effort required for these tasks, we present 
the GIN services [1](RRID:SCR_015864), a suite of tools designed for 
comprehensive, reproducible and versioned management of scientific data.

GIN extends and is fully compatible with established versioning tools (git [2] 
and git-annex [3]) and offers seamless data access with methods provided by 
those tools or with common web protocols (HTML, WebDAV). Furthermore, it 
integrates with tools for data and metadata management [4,5,6] and provides 
indexing and easy web-based editing of metadata.

GIN combines the power of a repository management service (inspired by 
GitHub [7]) with data storage and offers easy to use interfaces for data 
management through a web browser, from the desktop file browser, from the 
command line, or in analysis scripts. GIN makes it straightforward to share 
data within a lab or with off-site collaborators and to work on it together. 
Finally, with GIN’s metadata indexing and DOI services any dataset can easily 
be made findable or citable for publication.
In summary, GIN offers a convenient and powerful solution for the demands of 
reliable and efficient data management in the lab, combined with seamless data 
sharing with collaborators and the general scientific community - open, FAIR, and straightforward

Abstract
Maintaining reproducible data workflows while keeping data in sync, backed up, and easily accessible from within and outside the lab is a key challenge in research. To minimize the time and effort required for these tasks, we present the GIN services [1], a suite of tools designed for comprehensive, reproducible and versioned management of scientific data.
GIN extends and is fully compatible with established versioning tools (git [2] and git-annex [3]) and offers seamless data access with methods provided by those tools or with common web protocols (HTML, WebDAV). Furthermore, it integrates with tools for data and metadata management [4,5,6,7] and provides indexing and easy web-based editing of metadata. GIN offers the power of a repository management service (inspired by GitHub [8]) with easy to use interfaces for data management through a web browser, from the desktop file browser, from the command line, or in analysis scripts. GIN makes it straightforward to share data within a lab or with off-site collaborators and to work on it together. Additional microservices, including GIN-Valid [9], a validation service for data formats, support automation and quality management of research data. GIN’s DOI service provides easy data publication with persistent identifiers.
In summary, GIN offers a convenient and powerful solution  for collaborative data management - open, FAIR, and straightforward.

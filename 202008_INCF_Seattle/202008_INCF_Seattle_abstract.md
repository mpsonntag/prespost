Abstract
Maintaining reproducible data workflows while keeping data in sync, backed up, and easily accessible from within and outside the lab is a key challenge in research. To minimize the time and effort required for these tasks, we present the GIN services [1](RRID:SCR_015864), a suite of tools designed for comprehensive, reproducible and versioned management of scientific data.
GIN extends and is fully compatible with established versioning tools (git [2] and git-annex [3]) and offers seamless data access with methods provided by those tools or with common web protocols (HTML, WebDAV). Furthermore, it integrates with tools for data and metadata management [4,5,6,7] and provides indexing and easy web-based editing of metadata. GIN combines the power of a repository management service (inspired by GitHub [8]) with data storage and offers easy to use interfaces for data management through a web browser, from the desktop file browser, from the command line, or in analysis scripts. GIN makes it straightforward to share data within a lab or with off-site collaborators and to work on it together. Additional microservices, including GIN-Valid [9], a validation service for data formats, support automation and quality management of research data. Finally, with GIN’s metadata indexing and DOI services any dataset can easily be made findable or citable for publication.
In summary, GIN offers a convenient and powerful solution  for collaborative data management - open, FAIR, and straightforward.

  - BCCN / INCF / Ethology! \o/ -> have a conference? use GCA-Web!
- NIX
  - general introduction:
    - description & data model
  - behind the scenes
    - RRID, working on getting it as an endorsed research tool
  - furthered integration of NIX with existing proprietary data formats and 
    ephys data via neo
  - during the workshop with pilsen we added support for reading and writing 
    of  
  - started working on a convenience tools and plottings library
  - nearly done with finishing support for a table like data structure to make storing 
    with heterogeneous data more convenient.
- odML
    - general introduction
      - description
      - data model
    - behind the scenes - RRID, endorsed research tool
    - working on a way to use RDF (semantic web, graph databases) to search across 
      multiple documents and also to search across and link back to published datasets.
    - terminologies / templates
      - relaunched already existing terminologies page and added usage functions,
      - created a similar templates portal to DL existing and share custom templates
        that were created partially using terminology terms
    - created tools for convenience browsing of existing documents
    - odmltables
      - collaborators created a tool based on the odml core library to make
        the day to day work with odml more convenient 
      - paper
      - feature description
        - create new documents
        - filter large documents -> create easy to view and easy to share 
        - convert to table for editing and converting back to odml.
- gin
    - general introduction
      - feature description
      - usage figure?
      - current statistics
      - behind the scenes: it is a neuroscience data repository endorsed by DataCite and PLOS
    - gin microservices
      - gin doi + statistics
      - gin valid
        - presentation
        - validators on request?
      - GSoC / gin-proc?
        - project overview
        - current state
- NFDI Neuroscience initiative
  - NFDI background
    - A DFG call to 
    "The aim of the national research data infrastructure (NFDI) is to 
       systematically manage scientific and research data, 
       provide long-term data storage, backup and accessibility, and 
       network the data both nationally and internationally.
     The NFDI will bring multiple stakeholders together in a coordinated network of 
     consortia tasked with providing science-driven data services to research communities."

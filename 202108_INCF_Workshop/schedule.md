About this workshop
In this 3-day workshop we will demonstrate the NIX data model and format for (neuro)scientific data. We will introduce the basic concepts of the data model and library in lectures and exercises using data from real use cases. In interactive exercise sessions we will cover how to store various types of neuroscience data, together with their metadata and relations, tag points and regions, and automatically create fully labeled plots from the stored information. Users are also invited to present their data structures and start storing them in NIX. Finally, we will address the interoperability with the NEO objects for electrophysiological data and the Elephant toolbox.

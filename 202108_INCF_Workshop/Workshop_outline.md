# INCF NIX workshop outline

## Organizational Issues to address 
- Data carpentry Instructor Notes can be helpful
- People should have a stable internet connection
- they should not be limited by using a Windows machine
  -> points to binder or another online jupyter notebook

- how should people run the notebooks
  - we could use binder / kaggle
  - we could host a jupyter notebook server for the course
  - we could provide a Linux VM that people need to DL and run?
  - we could try to use a cloud docker container

- have a gin or github repository containing all materials that are and will stay publicly accessible
- if they have a Linux or MacOS machine, they should be able to run jupyter notebooks locally
  -> specify a list of local packages that have to be installed prior to the workshop
- organizers need to decide where and how the course will take place
  -> probably a zoom conference?
  - will need breakout rooms for 10 people groups -> 
  - do we record the presentations? if yes students need to be aware of it and might need to consent up front
  - if we record - will we put the videos up onto the gin / github repo as well?

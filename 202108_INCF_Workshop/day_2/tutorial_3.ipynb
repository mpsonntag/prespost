    "# Chunking\n",

    "Let's assume that we have already filled the full 9 by 9 chunk with data. Now we want to increase the dataset by another 3 by 3 bit of data. With the large chunks we would ask the backend to reserve the full 9 by 9 matrix, and write just 9 data points into it. Reserving large amounts of memory takes more time, and if not filled up with meaningful data, creates larger files than strictly necessary.\n",

[1 - Introduction slide]

Hi everyone, I am Michael Sonntag and I am working at the German Neuroinformatics Node, or G-Node. We develop tools and provide services for handling scientific data from raw and metadata over automated workflows to data hosting collaboration and even data publication.

Here I want to give you a brief but hopefully enlightening introduction to the services and tools the G-Node has developed and is maintaining and hosting for your benefit.

[2 - GIN Introduction slide]
At the core of our development we provide free hosting and free publication of neuroscientific data.

The GIN data hosting service give you access to unlimited git based repositories that provides versioning of files and handling of large data files on a central available server, a commandline tool to automate uploading and working on various machines, collaboration in larger and even distributed teams.
Public data sets are eligible request a DOI for data publication to make your research persistently available.
Even though we encourage making data sets public, all repositories can be kept private even for collaborations.

Working with diverse data, settings and paradigms can be overwhelming. The G-Node has developed a format to collect metadata about experiments in a consistent and machine actionable way

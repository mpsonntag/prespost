Hi everyone, I am Michael Sonntag and I am working at the German Neuroinformatics Node, or G-Node, to develop tools and provide services for handling scientific data from raw over metadata over automated workflows to data hosting collaboration and even data publication.

With this pitch I want to give you a brief but hopefully interesting introduction to the services and tools and services that the G-Node has developed and is maintaining and hosting for your benefit.

At the core of our development we provide free hosting of scientific data. The gin data hosting service provides a git based repository that provides versioning of files and handling of large data files on a central available server, a commandline tool to automate uploading and working on various machines, collaboration in larger and even distributed teams.
Public data sets are eligible request a DOI for data publication to make your research persistently available.
Even though we encourage making data sets public, all repositories can be kept private even for collaborations.

Working with diverse data, settings and paradigms can be overwhelming. The G-Node has developed a format to collect metadata about experiments in a consistent and machine actionable way

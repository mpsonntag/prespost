Managing neuroscience data requires the integration of information from multiple sources. Different types of recordings may be combined with elaborated stimulation, requiring background information or metadata to interpret them correctly. Storing such information consistently is an essential part of experimental research and depends crucially on available file formats. Many existing formats are vendor or domain specific, or provide only limited support for storing metadata along with the data. Here we present the NIX format [1], an open file format that is versatile enough to represent various kinds of data in conjunction with metadata to facilitate data organization and data retrieval in the lab, as well as data sharing. The format is compliant with the INCF requirements for storing electrophysiology data [2]. It enables storing recorded or derived data as well as all the meta-information about the experimental context, accounting for the relationships between data items. Data arrays are defined with units and dimension descriptors, so that the stored data can be readily interpreted as recorded quantities. The format further enables specifying the relationships between the data arrays and to describe points or regions of interest, such as areas in an image or events in a recorded signal. The NIX software libraries support direct access to these targeted parts of the data and the linked metadata. This enables selecting specific subsets of the data, such as signals recorded from a certain electrode channel, or spike trains from a certain single unit in trials with a given stimulus. NIX stores data and metadata using the HDF5 format [3]. While it is possible to read and write these files using the standard HDF5 libraries, efficient use of the features of the NIX format is facilitated by specific libraries provided for different languages, including C++, Python [4], Matlab [5], and Java. Packages and installers for different platforms are provided, as well as detailed documentation, examples, and tutorials [6]. The NIX file format supports comprehensive annotation and efficient organization of neuroscience data, and the variety of libraries makes it easy to integrate access to data and metadata in the lab data collection and analysis workflow.

Modern day scientists are challenged with a main obstacle: huge amounts of data. The annotation of
experimental data with metadata is vital to provide context for further analysis inside the lab and
with collaborators or meta-studies. We previously presented odML[1] as an approach to data annotation,
collecting metadata in an organized, easy to use, easy to read fashion providing an intuitive format for
archiving and collaboration. Recent initiatives like the FAIR principles[2] showed the need for publication
of properly annotated data on an even larger scale.

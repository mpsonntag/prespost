According to the FAIR principles[1], (meta)data is supposed to be [F]indable, [A]ccessible,
[I]nteroperable, [R]eusable. Metadata, data about experimental data, have a special role in
this context. Not only do they accurately describe the experimental setup but ideally also
the dataset involved. If handled properly, a collection of metadata is the first step to
solving the FAIR principles for a dataset. As previously shown[2] by the example of the NWB[3]
and odML[4] data formats, [I]nteroperability between even diverse metadata can be achieved by
using the common and flexible semantic web RDF technology.
Expanding on this idea, here we want to show how [F]indability and [A]ccessibility of large
collections of metadata can be achieved by the use of open source software. [I]nteroperability
between different types of metadata is achieved by a minimal set of common RDF terms.
This way diverse metadatasets can be easily converted and imported into a common searchable
data graph. Taking advantage of the powerful OWL feature of RDF, each distinct set of metadata
can be subclassed to the benefit of maintaining the original structure without losing the common
generic structure keeping [I]nteroperability without sacrificing [F]indability.
To make large collections of merged metadata in RDF format easily [A]ccessible, we introduce an
augmented version of the open source RDF server Apache Fuseki[5]. This server provides access
to the metadata by both custom, easy to use search terms as well as the powerful SPARQL query language.

Data is at the core of science. During the last decades the amount of scientific data has dramatically increased, experimental procedures and data analysis have become elaborate and multi-tiered. This increase in complexity often require different specialists to collaborate from data acquisition over analysis to result presentation, leading to challenges on multiple levels. Scientific data has to be annotated with information about the experimental setup (metadata), analysis steps have to be documented and be made available side by side with the original data to ensure ease of collaboration and reproducibility of final results. As the amount of data increases, organization and storage, exchange with off-site collaborators and persistent availability for publication becomes increasingly challenging as well.

At the German Neuroinformatics Node, a data management infrastructure for cellular and systems neurophysiology is being developed to improve data analysis and annotation with metadata as well as data access, data storage and exchange. The NIX[1] format was specifically designed as a format for scientific data and enables storage of raw and data resulting from various steps of analysis within the same file. NIX support of odML[2], the open metadata markup language, provides convenient annotation with metadata about experimental setup and analysis parameters, linked to the corresponding raw and analysed data in the same file. A plugin to NEO[3] adds out of the box support for convenient access and analysis of electrophysiological data.
Lab wide data management is enabled by the GIN[4] (G-Node Infrastructure) service, a free service designed for comprehensive and reproducible management of scientific data. It provides built in versioning, sync and backup of files under its control as well as secure remote access to the data. A command line client interface enables automation of data acquisition and analysis into every day data management workflow. GIN furthermore makes it straightforward to share any data within a lab or with off-site collaborators and to work on it in parallel. Any data hosted with the service can easily be made persistently available for publication.

The GIN services in combination with the NIX format enable to streamline the lab data workflows and reduce the efforts involved in sharing data with collaborators or the community.

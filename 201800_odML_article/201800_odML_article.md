\subsubsection{Hierarchical metadata in the odML format}
\label{subodML}

odML\footnote{see: \texttt{https://github.com/G-Node/python-odml}} (Open metadata mark up language, RRID:SCR\_001376) is a versatile \xml -based hierarchical format for metadata \citep{Grewe_2011} developed by the German Neuroinformatics Node (G-Node). While odML was originally designed for electrophysiological metadata, its generic structure makes it also applicable to other scientific contexts.

Since the release of the original version, odML has been used in various software projects for storing metadata as they become available during data acquisition or analysis [e.g. in the NIX\footnote{\texttt{https://github.com/G-Node/nix}} and RELACS\footnote{\texttt{https://github.com/relacs/relacs}} projects], as a part of the metadata data pipeline as described by \cite{Zehl_2016}, or as an integral part in the odMLtables project.

The basic idea behind odML to use enhanced key-value pairs (so called \textbf{Property}) that are grouped in a tree-like structure of \textbf{Sections} contained in a common \textbf{Document} (figure \ref{fig:odml_versions} B). The usage of odML in different environments with varying requirements has led to diversification, the identification of unused features, and the need for improvement of the original data model. For example, odML needed to be re-implemented in C++ in the case of the NIX and RELACS projects to accommodate a different storage backend than the text-based XML format, in case of the odMLtables project, the original internal data representation required only a subset of the complete odML data model. These re-implementations did not always stick to the original odML specifications and led to a diversification of the available odML data models. In order to remedy this situation with the latest release of odML version 1.4\footnote{\texttt{https://github.com/G-Node/python-odml/releases/tag/v1.4.0}} (i) unused features were removed, (ii) the data model was simplified and adapted to ensure odML compatibility between the various project implementations and (iii) some new features were implemented. We will briefly review the changes and describe odML data model. 

\paragraph{Removal of unused features}

We dropped support of storing binary data within the values. This feature has, to our knowledge, never been used. Approaches combining data and metadata storage (e.g. the NIX project) actually left this feature needless. Dropping it allowed us to also remove additional fields in the Value entity that were devoted solely to this purpose. Further, the mapping functionality was dropped. The idea behind this feature was to allow to map metadata used according to one definition to a different definition. As before, to our knowledge, this functionality has not been used and becomes actually obsolete when metadata are converted to formats using semantic web technologies. Again, this allowed us to remove now unnecessary fields from the model.

\paragraph{Model simplification}
Several fields could be removed due to the dropping of both mapping feature and support for binary content. Another major change was the merging of Value and Property entities of the original data model (compare figure \ref{fig:odml_versions} A and B). In principle, it has been possible to store values of completely different types within the same Property. For example, storing a numeric value (e.g. the temperature) together with a textual value (describing something related but different) would have been possible. This in turn effectively made stored metadata verbose and susceptible to ambiguity between Property and Value level. In the current version, all values stored within a Property must have the same data-type (integer, double, boolean, string…) and must have the same physical unit. This change did not only reduce redundancy and in turn file size, but also reduced the chance that core attributes "unit", "uncertainty", "data type" and "reference" of values can be ambiguously defined or interpreted. For compatibility with the odML implementation in the NIX project, odML entities now contain a UUID (auto-generated unique identifier with extremely low collision probability) that uniquely identifies every single odML entity even across unrelated odML files.

    \caption{\textbf{Comparison of odML data-models.} A) Version 1.3 data model. Each box represents a so called entity defined in the data model. In the original version odML defined four different entities: The \textbf{Document} as the root element of a metadata file contains information about the author, document date, the document version and a default repository containing definitions used within the document (if not overwritten within the document). The \textbf{Document} contains so called \textbf{Section}s which are grouping elements which in turn can have sub-sections and may contain \textbf{Property} entities. These have a name and contains at least one \textbf{Value} thus creating an extended key-value pair. For more information please refer to the origin publication \citep{Grewe_2011}. Connections between the entities are illustrated using the crow-foot notation. The connection Property-Value indicates that a \textbf{Property} can have one-to-many \textbf{Value}s. The Section-Property, on the other hand is zero-to-many, i.e a \textbf{Section} may contain several properties. B) Version 1.4 data model. Dropping of unused features allowed to simplify the data model which finds the Value entity removed and its attributes integrated into the \textbf{Property} entity. In the current version, a \textbf{Property} can still have multiple values but these must be of the same type, share the same unit etc. See the text for more details.}

\paragraph{Additional features}
On the side of the odML python library, we integrated an export to the RDF (Resource Description Framework) format opening odML to the semantic web. With this, the content of multiple odML files exported into the same graph can be can be easily searched using the established SPARQL query language. So far, the odML library used XML as a storage format. With the new version, XML is still the default storage format, but to support easy consumption through web-based services, metadata can now be stored in JSON and Yaml as well and be converted from one to the other formats. 

For easy visualization and manipulation of specific odML files, the groups from Jülich and the G-Node worked more closely together to integrate the odMLtables into the previously described odML graphical user interface. To simplify the integration of the core odML library into other projects, such as odMLtables, the odML graphical user interface was removed from the core library and moved to its own project odml-ui\footnote{\texttt{https://github.com/G-Node/odml-ui}}. odml-ui itself was updated to the new core odML version and now grants direct access points to the main odMLtables features making odml-ui and odMLtables even easier to use back to back leaving odml-ui as the file browsing and odMLtables as the file editing part.

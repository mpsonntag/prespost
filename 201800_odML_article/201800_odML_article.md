odML\footnote{see: \texttt{https://github.com/G-Node/python-odml}} (Open metadata mark up language, RRID:SCR\_001376) 
is a versatile \xml -based hierarchical format for metadata \citep{Grewe_2011} developed by 
the German Neuroinformatics Node (G-Node). While odML was originally designed for electrophysiological metadata, 
its generic structure makes it also applicable to other scientific contexts. In the following, we describe odML in 
its version v1.4\footnote{\texttt{https://github.com/G-Node/python-odml/releases/tag/v1.4.0}}, which includes multiple 
improvements compared to the API described by \citet{Grewe_2011}.

Since the release of the original version odML has been used in various software projects as plugin to provide
a predefined and available metadata format e.g. in the NIX (https://github.com/G-Node/nix) and RELACS 
(https://github.com/relacs/relacs) projects or as an integral part as in the odMLtables project as well as a 
standalone metadata data pipeline as described by Zehl et al.

The usage in everyday metadata pipelining as well as the integration of the core library in odMLtables lead to the 
discovery of various shortcomings and lead to the demand of new features with respect to the original version
of odML. In addition the re-implementation of odML in other languages than the original implementation e.g. in C++
or Matlab in the NIX project lead to a diversification of the core odML data format.

To rid the project of smaller shortcomings and as a step to unify the odML variants, the latest release, 
version 1.4 of odML, introduced heavy changes to the data model as well as to the functionality.
The data model was significantly simplified by merging the Property and Value entities. This not only effectively 
reduced redundancy and in turn file size, but also reduced the chance that core attributes "unit", "uncertainty", 
"data type" and "reference" of values can be ambiguously defined or interpreted. The mapping synonym functionality was 
removed [xxx maybe expand here on the reasons]. Support for the "binary" data type has been dropped. For 
compatibility with the odML implementation in the NIX project, odML entities now contain a UUID effectively uniquely 
identifying every single odML entity even across unrelated odML files.

As the two main shortcomings of the odML core library we identified the need to search across multiple odML files and 
the need to easily visualize and manipulate the content of specific odML files.
To address the first shortcoming we integrated an export to the RDF (Resource Description Framework)
format opening odML to the semantic web. Graphs containing the content of multiple odML files can easily be constructed
and searched using the established SPARQL query language.

To address the need to easily visualize and manipulate odML files JÃ¼lich and G-Node started to work more closely 
together to integrate the odMLtables into the previously described odML graphical user interface.

To enable better integration of the core odML library into odML tables, the odML graphical user interface was removed 
from the core library and moved to its own project odml-ui (https://github.com/G-Node/odml-ui). odml-ui itself
was updated to the new core odML version and now contains direct access points to the main odMLtables functionality
making odml-ui and odMLtables even easier to use back to back leaving odml-ui as the file browsing and odMLtables as
the file editing part. 


2.1.2 Hierarchical Metadata in the odML format

The hierarchical odML structure is flexible and consists of three types of objects (Fig.~\ref{odMLstructure}):
